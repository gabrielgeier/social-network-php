>Disclaimer: this was my first web project, back in 2018, so expect a messy code. 

Hello, and welcome to my social network! This was my first experience developing a web app. It dates from the first semester of 2018, when I had little to none knowledge about web development. I tried my best to fully grasp the experience, and to do so, i bet on PHP, without any help of a framework. As you can imagine, the code is very messy, and there is a lot of redundancy. Even in the front-end, i made without frameworks, to train my CSS, HTML and JS. Without a shadow of doubt, this freedom made my creativity jump to another level, and i could accomplish a lot of things.

So, what's that website about? Well, it's basically a social network designed for authors and readers of novels and fanfics. So, here, the user can:

- Create his own account, and furthermore edit it;
- Submit books (in multiple languages);
- View or download them;
- Search for both users and books;
- Use a dynamic chat in the book visualization page;
- Rate a publication, or favorite, even;
- See the ranking for authors, books, genres and languages;
- Make friends;
- Use his own feed or see his friend's;

As i mentioned before, the code isn't very organized, so i'm remaking the website using pyhton + pyramid framework as part of my TCC. 

Bellow is a little tour through the website (the GIF was too big, so needed to be splited).
