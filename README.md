> Hello, and welcome to my social network! This was my first experience developing a web app. It dates from the first semester of 2018, when I had little to none knowledge about web development. I tried my best to fully grasp the experience, and to do so, i bet on PHP, without any framework help. As you can imagine, the code is very messy, and there is a lot of redundancy. Even in the front-end, i made without frameworks, to train my CSS, HTML and JS. Without a shadow of doubt, this freedom made my creativity jump to another level, and i could accomplish a lot of things.

> So, without further ado, what's all that about?
